WORLD ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Here's a visualization using #microsoftpowerbi , showing the world energy consumption and production.

The dataset was provided by Quantum Analytics NG and several energy sources (coal, biofuel, nuclear, hydro, gas, oil, solar, low carbon, wind) from over 220 countries were analyzed and here are the major insights from 1900-2020.

Highlights All insights are based on the dataset provided as at the period of review

ðŸ“Œ The cumulative GDP within the review period is $5,664Trillion

ðŸ“Œ The total population analyzed is about 985Billion persons

ðŸ“Œ In Africa, Nigeria has the highest GDP contribution by energy followed by South Africa and Egypt

ðŸ“Œ The Annual cumulative GDP increased exponentially

ðŸ“Œ United States has more GDP contribution by various energy sources, followed by China, Japan, Germany, India, Russia and United Kingdom.

ðŸ“Œ As of 2020, China generated the most electricity, about 7,623Twh, followed by United States (4,049Twh) and India (1,314Twh)

ðŸ“Œ Asia Pacific is the most electricity generating region

ðŸ“Œ Visual showing the annual global primary energy consumption

ðŸ“Œ A visual showing oil production versus oil consumption across countries. For instance, Middle East produce about 500% more oil than they consume annually while Asia Pacific consumes about 400% more oil than they produce despite being the region that generate highest electricity.

ðŸ“ŒAs of 2020, Chad is one of the countries with the highest population without solar energy
